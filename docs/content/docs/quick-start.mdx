## 1. Create a Configuration File

Create a `penny.toml` file:

```toml
["myapp.example.com"]
address = "127.0.0.1:3001"
wait_period = "10m"
health_check = "/"
command = "node server.js"
```

This tells Penny:
- Route requests for `myapp.example.com` to `127.0.0.1:3001`
- Start the app with `node server.js`
- Check `GET /` to know when the app is ready
- Kill the app after 10 minutes of inactivity

## 2. Start Penny

```bash
penny serve penny.toml
```

That's it. Requests to `myapp.example.com` will start `node server.js`, proxy traffic to `127.0.0.1:3001`, and kill the process after 10 minutes of inactivity.

## 3. Validate Your Config

Before deploying, you can validate your configuration:

```bash
penny check penny.toml
```

This starts each app, runs its health check, and stops it to make sure everything works.
