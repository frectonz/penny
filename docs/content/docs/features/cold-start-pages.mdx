title: Cold Start Pages
description: Show a loading page during cold starts
---

By default, Penny blocks the connection during cold starts until the app is ready. With cold start pages enabled, browser users see a loading page that auto-refreshes until the app is up.

## Enable Cold Start Page

```toml
["myapp.example.com"]
address = "127.0.0.1:3001"
health_check = "/"
command = "node server.js"
cold_start_page = true
```

## Custom HTML Page

You can provide your own branded loading page:

```toml
["myapp.example.com"]
address = "127.0.0.1:3001"
health_check = "/health"
command = "node server.js"
cold_start_page_path = "./loading.html"
```

Setting `cold_start_page_path` implicitly enables `cold_start_page` — you don't need to set both. The HTML file is read once at startup.

## Custom Page Requirements

Your custom page **must** include a meta refresh tag so the browser automatically retries:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="2">
    <title>Loading...</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Starting up, please wait...</p>
</body>
</html>
```

A warning is logged at startup if the meta refresh tag is missing.

## How It Works

1. A request arrives for a cold app
2. Penny starts the app in the background
3. Instead of blocking, Penny immediately returns the cold start page
4. The page's meta refresh tag causes the browser to retry after a few seconds
5. Once the app is healthy, the next retry gets proxied to the actual app
