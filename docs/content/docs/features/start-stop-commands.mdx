title: Start and Stop Commands
description: Separate commands for graceful app lifecycle management
---

By default, Penny uses a single `command` to start your app and kills the process (SIGKILL) when the idle timeout expires.

## Simple Command

```toml
["myapp.example.com"]
command = "node server.js"
```

Penny starts the process and kills it when idle.

## Separate Start and Stop

If your app needs a graceful shutdown — for example a Docker container or a database — provide separate start and stop commands using the table form:

```toml
["myapp.example.com".command]
start = "docker start myapp"
end = "docker stop myapp"
```

When using the table form, Penny runs the `end` command on shutdown instead of killing the process.

## When to Use Separate Commands

- **Docker containers**: Use `docker start`/`docker stop` for proper container lifecycle
- **Databases**: Ensure clean shutdown with proper flush/checkpoint
- **Process managers**: When the start command doesn't directly run the process (e.g., `systemctl start`)
- **Cleanup required**: When you need to run cleanup scripts on shutdown

## Timeouts

Both command forms respect the timeout settings:

```toml
["myapp.example.com"]
start_timeout = "30s"   # max time to wait for health check
stop_timeout = "30s"    # max time to wait for stop command
```
