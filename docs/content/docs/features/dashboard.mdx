Penny includes a built-in web dashboard that shows metrics, run history, and logs for all your apps.

## Enabling the Dashboard

Set `api_address` in your config to enable the dashboard on a separate port:

```toml
api_address = "0.0.0.0:3031"
```

Or route it through the proxy with automatic TLS:

```toml
api_domain = "penny.example.com"
```

You can use both simultaneously.

## Authentication

Protect the dashboard with a password:

```bash
penny serve penny.toml --password mysecret
```

Or use an environment variable:

```bash
PENNY_PASSWORD=mysecret penny serve penny.toml
```

## Dashboard Features

- **Total overview**: Aggregate run counts, uptime, and failure rates across all apps
- **Per-app metrics**: Individual stats for each configured app
- **Run history**: Start/stop times, durations, and outcomes with pagination
- **Logs**: Captured stdout/stderr for each run
- **Time-range filtering**: Filter all metrics by time range

## API Endpoints

The dashboard is backed by a REST API:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/version` | Penny version info |
| `GET /api/overview` | Total overview metrics |
| `GET /api/apps/:hostname` | Per-app overview |
| `GET /api/apps/:hostname/runs` | Run history with pagination |
| `GET /api/runs/:id/logs` | Logs for a specific run |
| `GET /api/auth/status` | Authentication status |

All endpoints except auth status require authentication when a password is set.
