description: Pre-warm related apps when traffic arrives
---

Apps can declare relationships so that traffic to one pre-warms another in the background.

## Configuration

```toml
["api.example.com"]
address = "127.0.0.1:3001"
command = "node api.js"
health_check = "/health"
also_warm = ["frontend.example.com"]

["frontend.example.com"]
address = "127.0.0.1:3002"
command = "node frontend.js"
health_check = "/"
```

## How It Works

When a request hits `api.example.com`, Penny starts `frontend.example.com` in the background, anticipating it will be needed soon.

The warmed app gets its own idle timer — if no direct traffic arrives, it shuts down after its `wait_period` as usual.

## Use Cases

- **API + Frontend**: When users hit the API, they'll likely need the frontend too
- **Microservices**: Warm up downstream services when an upstream receives traffic
- **Multi-app sites**: Start related apps together to reduce overall cold start time
