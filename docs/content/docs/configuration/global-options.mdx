description: Top-level configuration options for Penny
---

Global options are set at the top level of your `penny.toml` file, before any app sections.

## Options

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `api_address` | — | Address for the dashboard/API server (e.g. `0.0.0.0:3031`) |
| `api_domain` | — | Route the dashboard through the proxy with TLS (e.g. `penny.example.com`) |
| `database_url` | `sqlite://penny.db` | SQLite database path for storing run history and metrics |

## Example

```toml
api_address = "0.0.0.0:3031"
api_domain = "penny.example.com"
database_url = "sqlite://penny.db"
```

## Notes

- `api_address` enables the built-in dashboard on a separate port. This is useful when you want to access the dashboard directly without going through the proxy.
- `api_domain` routes the dashboard through Penny's proxy, giving it automatic TLS. When set, the dashboard is accessible at `https://penny.example.com`.
- You can use both `api_address` and `api_domain` simultaneously.
- The database stores run history, logs, and metrics. The default SQLite path is relative to the working directory.
