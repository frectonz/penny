description: Manage Penny as a systemd user service
---

Manage Penny as a systemd user service (Linux only). Generates a unit file that wraps `penny serve` in your login shell so your full PATH (nvm, cargo, etc.) is available.

## Subcommands

### install

```
penny systemd install <config> [OPTIONS]
```

Creates `~/.config/systemd/user/penny.service`, enables and starts it, and runs `loginctl enable-linger` so the service starts at boot without a login session.

**Options** (same as `penny serve`):

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--address <ADDR>` | `0.0.0.0:80` | HTTP listen address |
| `--https-address <ADDR>` | `0.0.0.0:443` | HTTPS listen address |
| `--no-tls` | — | Disable TLS even if configured |
| `--password <PASSWORD>` | — | Dashboard password |

### uninstall

```
penny systemd uninstall
```

Stops and removes the Penny systemd service.

### status

```
penny systemd status
```

Shows the current status of the Penny service (passthrough to `systemctl`).

### restart

```
penny systemd restart
```

Restarts the Penny service. Useful after editing `penny.toml`.

### logs

```
penny systemd logs [--follow]
```

Shows Penny service logs (passthrough to `journalctl`). Use `--follow` to tail logs in real time.

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Install and start as a service
penny systemd install penny.toml --password mysecret

# Check status
penny systemd status

# After editing penny.toml
penny systemd restart

# View logs
penny systemd logs --follow

# Remove the service
penny systemd uninstall
```
