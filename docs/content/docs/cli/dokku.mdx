Penny integrates with [Dokku](https://dokku.com/) to manage Dokku apps on demand.

## Usage

The `penny dokku` command generates a `penny.toml` configuration from your Dokku apps:

```bash
penny dokku generate [OPTIONS]
```

This inspects your Dokku apps and creates the appropriate configuration with `docker start` / `docker stop` commands.

## Integration with Dokku

When using Penny with Dokku, apps use the table form of the `command` field for graceful container management:

```toml
["myapp.example.com".command]
start = "docker start myapp.web.1"
end = "docker stop myapp.web.1"
```

This ensures Dokku containers are properly started and stopped rather than being killed.
