title: penny check
description: Validate your configuration
---

Validate your configuration by starting each app, running its health check, and stopping it.

## Usage

```
penny check <config> [OPTIONS]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<config>` | Path to the penny.toml configuration file |

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--apps <HOSTS>` | Comma-separated list of specific apps to check |

## Examples

```bash
# Check all apps
penny check penny.toml

# Check specific apps
penny check penny.toml --apps app1.example.com,app2.example.com
```

## What It Does

For each app (or the ones specified with `--apps`):

1. Runs the start command
2. Waits for the health check to pass
3. Stops the app

This verifies that your commands work and health checks pass before deploying.
